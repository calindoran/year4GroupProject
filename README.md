# year4GroupProject
 Final year group project
  
  This project is about a Movie Recommendation App, not unlike Netflix, it will provide suggestions to potential users through a filtering process based on likes and or preferences. Information will be taken from the users input, that information will also reflect the usage of the product by the user, as well as the assigned ratings. This Movie Recommendation App will be a system that provides the user with various types of content based on user likes and or preferences. The Movie Recommendation App will also take information about the user as an input.
